## Configuring and Building Fuzzy

In order to compile Fuzzy you need following software packages:
- GCC compiler
- flex
- bison

Basic configuring and building:
```sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
```
Now as the root user:
```sh
make install
```

Please see the INSTALL file for additional options.

**Tip:** Remove debugging symbols from the fuzzy binary then gzip it to get it running as portable such as running on a virtual machine on a cloud::
```sh
strip -d fuzzy
gzip fuzzy
```
